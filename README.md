awesome stuff in the avalanche ecosystem

### Onboarding

To move assets (ie, ETH and ERC-20s) from Ethereum to Avalanche you can use the Avalanche Bridge:

https://bridge.avax.network/

Once you've bridged your tokens, head to Pangolin to start trading or providing liquidity:

https://pangolin.exchange/

### Pangolin

Pangolin is the oldest Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on the Avalanche Network and was developed by an Ava Labs engineer. You can do two things on Pangolin: trade or provide liquidity. Providing liquidity will give you "Liquidity Provisioning" (LP) tokens that you can "stake" for rewards on Pangolin and many other applications in the Avalanche ecosystem.

#### Trade

If you've just come over the bridge, you probably want to ape into a few tokens as soon as possible - to get started head to Pangolin's swap page:

https://app.pangolin.exchange/#/swap

Use the token list picker at the bottom of the "From" token selection dialog to find your bridged tokens (listed in the AVAX Bridge Tokens list as of August 11, 2021) and use the token list picker at the bottom of the "To" token selection dialog to find some interesting new coins. We recommend the "AVAX DeFi Tokens" list, full of innovative Avalanche-native projects.

#### Provide Liquidity

Liquidity provisioning is at the heart of Decentralized Finance, and is critical to the functioning of DEXes like Pangolin. To provide liquidity, you "stake" - ie, voluntarily lock up - equal values of two tokens to get "LP tokens" - in this case, a token called PGL. The tokens you lock up will be added to the "Liquidity Pool" that Pangolin uses to facilitate swaps between those tokens. Your PGL tokens represent your share of the liquidity pool.

There is some risk associated with providing liquidity -- read up on [Impermanent Loss](https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/) -- so most DEXes reward their liquidity providers with a reward token associated with the exchange. 

Pangolin's reward token is [PNG](https://info.pangolin.exchange/#/token/0x60781c2586d68229fde47564546784ab3faca982) and you can get some by adding to a liquidity pool here:

https://app.pangolin.exchange/#/pool

and then staking the "PGL" LP tokens you get in return here:

Note that different liquidity pools give different amounts of PNG rewards - see the "Earn up to (yearly)" field on the PNG page to get an idea of how lucrative each of the pools is right now.

You can also use your PGL to earn rewards from a variety of other applications in the Avalanche ecosystem. Examples of these include:

* [Snowball](https://snowball.network/) - stake your PGL to automatically compound PNG rewards and also earn SNOB rewards
* [Penguin Finance](https://penguinfinance.org/) - stake your PGL for PEFI rewards
* [Yield Yak](https://yieldyak.com/) - stake your YAK-AVAX PGL for AVAX rewards
* [Avaware](https://avaware.network/farm) - stake your PGL for AVE rewards


### Other DEXes

There are a variety of other DEXes in the Avalanche ecosystem:

#### Elk

https://elk.finance/

Elk is an unusual DEX - it's already live on Avalanche, Polygon, HECO, and Fantom and plans to expand to BSC and xDai next week. The ELK token can be moved from chain to chain, and they've built a full DEX on each chain, complete with staking rewards. Eventually Elk will let you swap tokens on one chain for tokens on another in a single operation.
