awesome stuff in the avalanche ecosystem

### Onboarding

To move assets (ie, ETH and ERC-20s) from Ethereum to Avalanche you can use the Avalanche Bridge:

https://bridge.avax.network/

Once you've bridged your tokens, head to Pangolin to start trading or providing liquidity:

https://pangolin.exchange/

### Pangolin

Pangolin is the oldest Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on the Avalanche Network. You can do two things on Pangolin: trade or provide liquidity. Providing liquidity will entitle you to rewards, and will allow you to use a variety of yield optimizers and incentive pools in the Avalanche ecosystem.
